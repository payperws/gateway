Payper Gateway is an HTTP (reverse) proxy that verifies payments to route requests. As a practical application, it can be used to sell API requests for digital cash (crypto-currency) on the Internet. See the detailed description in this [medium article](https://medium.com/@alexandru.males/payper-p2p-micro-payments-for-the-open-api-economy-e8adee76d396?fbclid=IwAR25i3YekBZ82ETVOTDaNnYH-zo7R4niaVHrhDRknwptWLlha8WwT-7ORp4).

## Concept
The gateway is part of a larger concept called Payper that deals with peer-to-peer (disintermediated) payment processing for APIs. Payper is a toolset that aims to bring together crypto-currency micropayments and APIs (web services in general) in order to allow open trading of digital resources on the Internet.

## Installation
Payper Gateway works as a backend java-based component, so it is no different than running an usual JVM based service. Until it is going to be available as a docker image or a fully executable jar in a release, it is necessary to compile and package in order to run it.
#### Prerequisites
* Java SDK 11 (or newer)
* Maven 3.5.0+
#### Dependencies
Payper Gateway uses [Hedera Java SDK](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-java) as a dependency that is not yet available in a maven repo. That is why it is necessary to install Hedera SDK separately.
```
git clone git@github.com:hashgraph/hedera-sdk-java.git
cd hedera-sdk-java
mvn install
```
#### Build and Run
1. Change dir into `payper-gateway` and build it:
```
mvn package
```

2. Run the Payper Gateway jar from your current directory:

```
java -jar target/gateway-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### Start-up with docker-compose

Run the docker-compose.yml

```
mvn package
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Stop the docker-compose

```
docker-compose down
```

## Implementation
This component basically integrates [Hedera Hashgraph](https://www.hedera.com) payment verification into an extension of [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway).
